# DataModelBuilder
The purpose of this project is to create a data model for any application. Then load it from a file and use insead of implementing the object structure using a programming language.

DataModelBuilder is a [Qt Quick](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html) application based on [QVL plugin](https://vllibrary.tech/?page=qvl) that allows to create and modify tree-like data models and the export them to JSON file which can then be loaded by any app using [DMBCore library](https://vllibrary.tech/?page=dmbcore) or any Qt Quick app using QVL plugin.

QVL is a Qt plugin that that allows you to create and use data models of any complexity even with inheritance using human-readable JSON format directly, or using DataModelBuilder app, or even with JavaScript during your application runtime.
